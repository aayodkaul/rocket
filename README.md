# SimToSpace!
# Rocket Simulation Website for Elementary School Students
 + Spent the summer before my senior year in high school self-learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop this website for students to learn about rocket propulsion and the physics revolving around spacecraft
 + Worked with my former elementary school to include it as part of the science class curriculum for 120 students to interact with it, and a year later, came into classrooms to teach when the school opened back up after the COVID-19 pandemic
